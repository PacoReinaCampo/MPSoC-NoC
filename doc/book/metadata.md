abstract: Network on Chip for a Multi-Processor System on Chip. A Multi-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC) is a System on Chip (SoC) which includes multiple Processing Units (PU). As such, it is a Multi-Core System-on-Chip. All PUs are linked to each other by a Network on Chip (NoC). These technologies meet the performance needs of multimedia applications, telecommunication architectures or network security. A Network on Chip (NoC) is a network-based communications subsystem on an integrated circuit, between modules in a System on a Chip (SoC). The modules on the IC are IP cores schematizing functions of the system, and are designed to be modular in the sense of network science. A NoC is based on a router packet switching network between SoC modules.
