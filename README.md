**Implementation in VHDL & (System)Verilog of a Network on Chip and simulation in GHDL & Icarus Verilog**

A Network on Chip (NoC) is a network based communications subsystem on an Integrated Circuit (IC), between modules in a System on a Chip (SoC). The modules on the IC are IP cores schematizing functions of the system, and are designed to be modular in the sense of network science. A NoC is a router based packet switching network between SoC modules.
